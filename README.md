# Dishes-at-Will
Web application for making a calendar and recipes with frontend and backend.

This project is made using a frontend with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and a backend with PHP and SQL.

This project also has a MVC design pattern separated in folders:

- Model: this folder contains sql file (for the initial database) and php files with different functions where the petitions to the database are made.
- View: this folder contains htmls and css files, which contain everything to be shown to the user.
- Controller: this folder contains js and php files, where the firsts ones control client-side petitions and the seconds ones control server-side petitions (before being made to the model).

I also hash the passwords and work with prepared statements in order to prevent SQL injections.

**This is not a serious project, it is only made to prove my skills.**

# How to prove it

You need to have XAMPP installed on your computer and that's all you need.

Import the sql file into PHPMyAdmin and open your browser with your server Apache running.

If you prove it and want to give me some feedback, I'm all ears. I want to hear you all and learn a lot from you.
