# Dishes-at-Will
Web application for making a calendar and recipes with frontend and backend.

This project is made using a frontend with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and a backend with PHP and SQL.

This is not a serious project, is only made to prove my skills.

# How to prove it

You need to have XAMPP installed on your computer and that's all you need.

Import the sql file into PHPMyAdmin and open your browser with your server Apache running.

If you prove it and want to give me some feedback, I'm all ears. I want to hear you all and learn a lot from you.
